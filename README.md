* PIL
* pylab
* matplotlib

Install these using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```

### Download

Download the files with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dougbrion/python-img-processing.git
```

### Use

Navigate into the directory of the Image Processing task and run the program you desire, for example:

```bash
cd Git/python-img-processing/Sobel
python sobel.py
```

The programs will output the processed result as a JPEG image in the same directory.
